# Julycheck

Functions help to automate repetitive tasks and enable you to reuse your code. 
Write your own function that accepts the current month as a parameter and prints one of the following responses,
depending on whether it is July or not:


```
It's July, so it can get really hot.
It’s not July, so at least we’re not in the peak of the heat.
```
